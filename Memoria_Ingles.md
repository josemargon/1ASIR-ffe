Through this month we have carried out the FFE of 1ºASIR, which consisted of 4 projects proposed by 4 different companies. 

The first project was proposed by Gesinle, and consisted of the creation of a virtual machine with an Ubuntu Server in which we installed and configured a Jitsi Meet server for online calls and video calls. 

The second project was proposed by Reload Innovación and consisted of the creation of an application to manage the human resources department of a company using Microsoft Power Apps. 

The third project was proposed by Proconsi, the objective was to create a PfSense firewall that would control the connections between a work device, a web server and the host machine, a total of 3 networks, LAN, WAN and DMZ in addition to configuring connections by SSH and VPN. 

The fourth and last project was presented by Tedra, in this we created two virtual machines with Proxmox and joined them in the cluster, we created an NFS server on an Ubuntu Server to store the images of the operating systems we use and we created, configured, migrated both machines and containers as well as backups of them.
